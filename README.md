# Invoice Generator

This is a simple invoice generator that I use for my personal invoices.

It will get the last exchange rate between BRL-USD from a valid weekday.

It will also format in the way I need my invoices and auto copy paste :P

Invoice example:

```
DOCUMENT INV-2024-17
ISSUE DATE September 10, 2024

Perform the duties of customizing, building data connectors, and specialized apps for working with our Odoo ERP implementation.
Will also work as a full stack developer building software for our customers, manufactures, and our own internal operations.
